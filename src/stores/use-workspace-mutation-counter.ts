/**
 * Monotonic counter that ticks every time the agent commits a file-editor
 * mutation in the workspace. Used as a cache-buster for resources we serve
 * via the agent server's static workspace fileserver (iframes, images, PDFs):
 * appending `?v=<count>` to those URLs forces the browser to re-request a
 * fresh copy after each edit instead of reusing the previously-fetched
 * response — important because the rendered HTML may reference other
 * assets (CSS, images) that the user can't see directly but expects to
 * reflect the latest version of the workspace.
 *
 * Consumers:
 *   - {@link useAutoRefreshFilesOnEdit} bumps this on each mutation event.
 *   - {@link FileContentViewer} reads the count and appends it to its
 *     `<iframe>` / `<img>` src.
