## Run this with OpenHands Agent Server first

If you only read one section of this README, read this one. Most users will want to clone this repo, point it at a real `openhands-agent-server`, and start using the UI immediately.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.12.x or later
- `npm`
- A running OpenHands Agent Server (`agent-server`)

### 1. Clone and install the frontend

```sh
git clone https://github.com/neubig/agent-server-gui.git
cd agent-server-gui
npm install
```

### 2. Install and start OpenHands Agent Server

If you do not already have the backend installed, install `uv` first (OpenHands SDK recommends `uv` 0.8.13+):

```sh
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Then install or upgrade the agent server package together with the tool/workspace dependencies that the SDK getting started page lists separately:

```sh
uv tool install -U \
  --with openhands-tools \
  --with openhands-workspace \
  --with libtmux \
  openhands-agent-server
```

`uv tool install` exposes the server as the `agent-server` CLI. If `~/.local/bin` is not already on your `PATH`, either add it or run the binary via its full path.

Then start the backend on the default local port:

```sh
agent-server --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

The frontend expects the backend at `127.0.0.1:8000` by default, so this is the easiest from-scratch setup.

If you start the backend with `SESSION_API_KEY` or `OH_SESSION_API_KEYS_0`, every `/api/*` route is authenticated with `X-Session-API-Key`. In that case the frontend must send the same key via `VITE_SESSION_API_KEY`.

If you prefer installing from source or want the full SDK setup flow, see the OpenHands SDK docs: <https://docs.openhands.dev/sdk/getting-started>

### 3. Optional: create a `.env` file

If your backend is **not** running on `127.0.0.1:8000`, or if it requires a session API key, create a `.env` file:

```sh
cp .env.sample .env
```

Then update the values you need:

```dotenv
VITE_BACKEND_HOST="127.0.0.1:8000"
VITE_BACKEND_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8000"
VITE_FRONTEND_PORT="3001"
# Use the same value as backend SESSION_API_KEY or OH_SESSION_API_KEYS_0 when auth is enabled.
# VITE_SESSION_API_KEY="your-session-api-key"
# VITE_WORKING_DIR="/absolute/path/to/the-workspace-used-by-agent-server"
```

Notes:

- `VITE_BACKEND_HOST` is used by the Vite dev proxy for `/api`, `/server_info`, and `/sockets`.
- `VITE_BACKEND_BASE_URL` is used by browser-side direct requests. Keep it pointed at the same backend.
- `VITE_WORKING_DIR` should match the workspace path the backend will use when starting new conversations.
- If the backend is secured with `SESSION_API_KEY` or `OH_SESSION_API_KEYS_0`, set `VITE_SESSION_API_KEY` to the same value or live requests will fail with `401 Unauthorized`.
- If your backend does not require `X-Session-API-Key`, leave `VITE_SESSION_API_KEY` unset.

### 4. Start the frontend

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts the frontend on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

### 5. First-run sanity check

After the page opens:

- `/` should load without errors
- `/settings` should load
  - on secured backends, make sure `VITE_SESSION_API_KEY` matches the backend session key
  - configure a working LLM model + API key under `Settings > LLM` before running the first live task
  - if your backend is too old to expose settings schemas, the UI will show an actionable `SDK settings schema unavailable.` message instead of crashing
- you should be able to open or create a conversation
- `/conversations/:id` should load conversation content
- if you want the Git / Changes panels to point at this repo, set `VITE_WORKING_DIR` to the actual repo root (for this checkout that is `/workspace/project/agent-server-gui`), not just the parent workspace directory

### Mock mode

If you want to run the frontend without a live backend, use:

```sh
npm run dev:mock
# or
npm run dev:mock:saas
```

## Overview

This repository is a near-direct port of the OpenHands frontend adapted to talk directly to `software-agent-sdk` / `agent_server` without the usual OpenHands app backend.

## Tech Stack

- Remix SPA Mode (React + Vite + React Router)
- TypeScript
- Redux
- TanStack Query
- Tailwind CSS
- i18next
- React Testing Library
- Vitest
- Mock Service Worker

## Building for Production

There is no `Makefile` in this repository. Use the npm scripts instead:

```sh
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Environment Variables

The frontend application uses the following environment variables:

| Variable                    | Description                                                                          | Default Value            |

You can create a `.env` file in the project directory with these variables based on `.env.sample`.

## Testing

### Testing Framework and Tools

We use the following testing tools:
- **Test Runner**: Vitest
- **Rendering**: React Testing Library
- **User Interactions**: @testing-library/user-event
- **API Mocking**: [Mock Service Worker (MSW)](https://mswjs.io/)
- **Code Coverage**: Vitest with V8 coverage

### Running Tests

To run all tests:
```sh
npm run test
```

To run tests with coverage:
```sh
npm run test:coverage
```

### Testing Best Practices

1. **Component Testing**
   - Test components in isolation
   - Use our custom [`renderWithProviders()`](https://github.com/OpenHands/OpenHands/blob/ce26f1c6d3feec3eedf36f823dee732b5a61e517/frontend/test-utils.tsx#L56-L85) that wraps the components we want to test in our providers. It is especially useful for components that use Redux
   - Use `render()` from React Testing Library to render components
   - Prefer querying elements by role, label, or test ID over CSS selectors
   - Test both rendering and interaction scenarios

2. **User Event Simulation**
   - Use `userEvent` for simulating realistic user interactions
   - Test keyboard events, clicks, typing, and other user actions
   - Handle edge cases like disabled states, empty inputs, etc.

3. **Mocking**
   - We test components that make network requests by mocking those requests with Mock Service Worker (MSW)
   - Use `vi.fn()` to create mock functions for callbacks and event handlers
   - Mock external dependencies and API calls (more info)[https://mswjs.io/docs/getting-started]
   - Verify mock function calls using `.toHaveBeenCalledWith()`, `.toHaveBeenCalledTimes()`

4. **Accessibility Testing**
   - Use `toBeInTheDocument()` to check element presence
   - Test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility
   - Verify correct ARIA attributes and roles

5. **State and Prop Testing**
   - Test component behavior with different prop combinations
   - Verify state changes and conditional rendering
   - Test error states and loading scenarios

6. **Internationalization (i18n) Testing**
   - Test translation keys and placeholders
   - Verify text rendering across different languages

Example Test Structure:
```typescript
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react";
import userEvent from "@testing-library/user-event";
import { describe, it, expect, vi } from "vitest";

describe("ComponentName", () => {
  it("should render correctly", () => {
    render(<Component />);
    expect(screen.getByRole("button")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it("should handle user interactions", async () => {
    const mockCallback = vi.fn();
    const user = userEvent.setup();

    render(<Component onClick={mockCallback} />);
    const button = screen.getByRole("button");

    await user.click(button);
    expect(mockCallback).toHaveBeenCalledOnce();
  });
});
```

### Example Tests in the Codebase

For real-world examples of testing, check out these test files:

1. **Chat Input Component Test**:
   [`__tests__/components/chat/chat-input.test.tsx`](https://github.com/OpenHands/OpenHands/blob/main/frontend/__tests__/components/chat/chat-input.test.tsx)
   - Demonstrates comprehensive testing of a complex input component
   - Covers various scenarios like submission, disabled states, and user interactions

2. **File Explorer Component Test**:
   [`__tests__/components/file-explorer/file-explorer.test.tsx`](https://github.com/OpenHands/OpenHands/blob/main/frontend/__tests__/components/file-explorer/file-explorer.test.tsx)
   - Shows testing of a more complex component with multiple interactions
   - Illustrates testing of nested components and state management

### Test Coverage

- Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical components
- Focus on testing different scenarios and edge cases
- Use code coverage reports to identify untested code paths

### Continuous Integration

Tests are automatically run during:
- Pre-commit hooks
- Pull request checks
- CI/CD pipeline
