 * darwin slices — a universal .app that carries only the host-arch runtime
 * silently breaks npx/uvx spawns on the other arch. These helpers decide

 *
 *   single-arch (default): resources/node/ and resources/bin/
 *   universal (macOS only): resources/node-{arm64,x64}/ and resources/bin-{arm64,x64}/
 *
 * The env-var semantics and directory names are pinned together with
 * electron-builder.config.mjs and electron/main.mjs — change one, change all.
